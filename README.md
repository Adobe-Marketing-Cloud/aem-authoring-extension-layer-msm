# Adobe Experience Manager 6 Extension: Create an MSM Layer in Page Authoring

Starting from AEM 6.1, the MSM Layer is part of the default Layers of the Page Authoring.

In AEM 6.2, the MSM Layer is defined in the MSM Editor plugin client library (``cq.authoring.editor.plugin.msm``), and the source code is available at ``/libs/wcm/msm/content/touch-ui/authoring/editor/js/msm.Layer``
